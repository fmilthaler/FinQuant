I was inspired to develop this program by recent application procedures in the finance sector. Being tasked with a typical exercise for a *Quant* position at an investment firm, I first started doing some reading about finance and financial portfolios in particular. Successfully completing the exercise felt good, but I had many more ideas on how to improve and extend my solution. The result of which is *FinQuant*.

My academical background is quite diverse, as I studied Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science, Systems & Control Engineering for my undergraduate and postgraduate courses respectively, followed by a doctorate in Computational Physics at Imperial College London. With that skillset I decided to go rogue and enter the field of Data Science/Engineering.

I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things, which is probably the reason for me working on this and other projects.

As mentioned above, *FinQuant* is a program for financial portfolio management, among others.
The module ``finquant.portfolio`` does exactly that.

.. note:: The impatient reader who simply wants to jump in and start using *FinQuant* is advised
    to jump to `build_portfolio`_ and have a look at and play around with the :ref:`examples`.
